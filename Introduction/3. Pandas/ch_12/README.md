- [Open data on Amazon Web Services](https://registry.opendata.aws/)
- [OpenML](https://www.openml.org)
- [SNAP library of datasets collected by Stanford University](https://snap.stanford.edu/data/index.html)

### Websites by Topic
This section contains selected data resources across various topics, which can be accessed through a website. Obtaining the data for an analysis may be as simple as downloading a CSV file or may require parsing HTML with pandas. If you must resort to scraping the page (make sure you have tried the ways we discussed in this book first), be sure that you aren't violating the terms of use of the website.
