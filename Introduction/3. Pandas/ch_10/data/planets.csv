3.35,WTS-1 b,0.0,The Hot Jupiter WTS-1 b is the first extrasolar planet found by the WFCAM Transit Survey. The observations were made at the 3.8-m United Kingdom Infrared Telescope and the Hobby-Eberly Telescope. The planet has one of the largest radius anomalies among the known Hot Jupiters its mass range.,transit,,12/10/04,0.047,4.01,,Confirmed planets,2012
1.0187068,WTS-2 b,,WTS-2 b is an unusually close hot Jupiter on a 1.02-day orbit around a K2V star. The planet is close to the tidal destruction radius of the star and has a predicted remaining lifetime of only 40 million years.,RV,,14/02/25,0.01855,1.12,,Confirmed planets,2014

2.61585922,XO-2N b,,The planet XO-2N b was the first planet discovered in the XO-2 binary. The host star is variable (Zellem et al. 2015) which complicates the analysis of the planetary properties. The stellar variability may be caused by starspots.,transit,,15/05/10,0.03673,0.597,,Confirmed planets,2007
,XO-2N c,,The radial velocity measurements of the star XO-2 exhibit a long-term quadratic trend. This trend correlates with stellar activity indicators so is more likely due to the stellar activity cycle rather than being caused by reflex motion from a planet.,RV,,15/05/10,,,,Controversial,2015

6.960,YBP1194 b,0.31,The star YBP1194 is one of the best solar twins identified so far. Its composition and age is very similar to that of our own Sun. It is located in the star cluster M67 and hosts a 0.33 Jupiter mass planet. The frequency of massive planets around stars of open clusters such as M67 turns out to be very similar to that of field stars.,RV,2455679.9,18/03/23,,0.3334,109.16,Confirmed planets,2014
